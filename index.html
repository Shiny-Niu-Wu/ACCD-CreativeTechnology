        <p>response to CRITICAL MAKING</p>
        <div>
          <p class="quotes">“Rather than just bemoaning the restrictions placed on users by institutionalized technological systems, engaged makers have the increasing ability and opportunity to constitute and construct alternatives.”</p>
          <p class="thoughts">One has to engage in order to be engaged. Here I am referring to which I believe is a core spirit of social practice/socially engaged art. Like critical making, to engage “viewers” and make them into “participants,” is to transfer the ownership of the work, to extend both the conceptual and physical processes of the work, and to reevaluate the values of work (in this case, being put in the museum/getting design awards is not the final and the most honorable ending). And to turn “participants” into “makers,” is to execute what the article suggests as “material interventions,” where each intervention could provide a different setting and therefore a different version of a project; projects become reusable components of thinking and building, a kit for unlimited critical making.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="quotes">“The ultimate goal of critical making experiences is not the evocative or pedagogical object intended to be experienced by others, but rather the creation of novel understandings by the makers themselves...The ‘objects’ of critical making are intended to be shared making experiences, curated through both material and textual instructions.”</p>
          <p class="thoughts">The challenging part of creating something to be outputted to the society is not the process of itself, nor is it the process of outputting. It is the part where the receiver receives that creates the most unexpected and sometimes problematic results/reactions. Artworks, products, or something else, how things are taken and used do not always align with the intended purposes and actual functions of how they should be. Applying this thought onto the quote, we want objects to have both shared experiences and the ability to share experiences. To achieve that, critical makers will have to first convince themselves of their criticality even before engaging with others, otherwise as Marshall McLuhan ironically stated: “You must talk to the media, not to the programmer. To talk to the programmer is like complaining to a hot dog vendor at a ballpark about how badly your favorite team is playing.” That’s how “material and textual instructions” could be prepared enough to then evolve into something that has the capacity to be shared.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="quotes">“the ‘push-back’ of the physical electronics – the resistance of reality to our attempts to contain it – is therefore more present...engender a more invested and involved participant”</p>
          <p class="thoughts">As a creative technologist with the background of interactive media art, I resonate with this sentence as it has always been a crucial concern regarding how deep the audience engages with my work. Adding a physical element to a work may add the incentive for a first interaction between the audience and the work, which could be a key to inspire them to then critically think about it afterwards. Besides the stimulation and fortified impression of having a multi-sensory experience, still, we need to jump from just the oohs and aahs of the magic of new technologies, or at least use it as a base, to then introduce to the general people, including ourselves, the possibility of critical making. The article brought together the often separated social aspect and technical aspect of critiquing the world, and asked us, with the two combined, to become more “invested and involved” as we all could be critical makers.</p>
