          <p>response to <a href="http://opendesignnow.org/index.html%3Fp=434.html">CRITICAL MAKING</a></p>
          <div>
            <p class="quotes">“Rather than just bemoaning the restrictions placed on users by institutionalized technological systems, engaged makers have the increasing ability and opportunity to constitute and construct alternatives.”</p>
            <p class="thoughts">One has to engage in order to be engaged. Here I am referring to which I believe is a core spirit of social practice/socially engaged art. Like critical making, to engage “viewers” and make them into “participants,” is to transfer the ownership of the work, to extend both the conceptual and physical processes of the work, and to reevaluate the values of work (in this case, being put in the museum/getting design awards is not the final and the most honorable ending). And to turn “participants” into “makers,” is to execute what the article suggests as “material interventions,” where each intervention could provide a different setting and therefore a different version of a project; projects become reusable components of thinking and building, a kit for unlimited critical making.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p class="quotes">“The ultimate goal of critical making experiences is not the evocative or pedagogical object intended to be experienced by others, but rather the creation of novel understandings by the makers themselves...The ‘objects’ of critical making are intended to be shared making experiences, curated through both material and textual instructions.”</p>
            <p class="thoughts">The challenging part of creating something to be outputted to the society is not the process of itself, nor is it the process of outputting. It is the part where the receiver receives that creates the most unexpected and sometimes problematic results/reactions. Artworks, products, or something else, how things are taken and used do not always align with the intended purposes and actual functions of how they should be. Applying this thought onto the quote, we want objects to have both shared experiences and the ability to share experiences. To achieve that, critical makers will have to first convince themselves of their criticality even before engaging with others, otherwise as Marshall McLuhan ironically stated: “You must talk to the media, not to the programmer. To talk to the programmer is like complaining to a hot dog vendor at a ballpark about how badly your favorite team is playing.” That’s how “material and textual instructions” could be prepared enough to then evolve into something that has the capacity to be shared.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p class="quotes">“the ‘push-back’ of the physical electronics – the resistance of reality to our attempts to contain it – is therefore more present...engender a more invested and involved participant”</p>
            <p class="thoughts">As a creative technologist with the background of interactive media art, I resonate with this sentence as it has always been a crucial concern regarding how deep the audience engages with my work. Adding a physical element to a work may add the incentive for a first interaction between the audience and the work, which could be a key to inspire them to then critically think about it afterwards. Besides the stimulation and fortified impression of having a multi-sensory experience, still, we need to jump from just the oohs and aahs of the magic of new technologies, or at least use it as a base, to then introduce to the general people, including ourselves, the possibility of critical making. The article brought together the often separated social aspect and technical aspect of critiquing the world, and asked us, with the two combined, to become more “invested and involved” as we all could be critical makers.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="quotes">“the hacker impulse expresses itself via a constellation of minor acts of insurrection, often undertaken by individuals, creatively disguised to deprive authorities of the opportunity to retaliate”</p>
            <p class="thoughts">I immediately connect this to the coding structure of web scraping, where there often has to be ‘sleep’ functions to temporarily pause the data-scraping process from a website, which could cause suspicion since the process is fast; also better not have many people in the same place scraping from a single source. In the age of data, we look at everything as resources out there that are either available to our hands or should be available, chunks of information that could be further repurposed. The hard part is always to find a middle ground, even with various licenses available. Some data is not meant to be publicly visible, but people just get smarter and better at finding loopholes in both technology designs and information regulations. Putting these adventures of findings as constellations of acts is kind of poetic, though.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="quotes">“Each group defines itself against the other, settling into a stagnant trench warfare. The individual activists frequently end up demoralised, complaining within echo-chambers about their inability to impact ‘the system’. They build an identity based on a kind of downbeat martyrdom, keeping themselves afloat through a fetishised solidarity with others in the same position.”</p>
            <p class="thoughts">This is so true for other social events as well, especially the politics. And those individuals claim that they are individuals to combat the allegation of being blind followers with the ‘fetishised solidarity’ with others. They even take their acclaimed inability to fight with the systems and exaggerate it, somehow thinking this would legitimize this solidarity in the beliefs against the current.<br>This could be implying the phenomenon of ‘cultured young people’ in Taiwan where the word ‘culture’ here has to interestingly associate with both the subcultural hipster style and the current Taiwanese politics. In fact, more and more public workshops on ‘social hacking’ appear and are seemed to be led by those people. Whatever act in and out of itself could never step away from politics. From all of these we could also see hints of the practice of hacking growing, from a subculture to a slowly dominating culture.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p class="quotes">“It thus becomes an assertion of individual defiance of social norms. The byproduct of such exploration is pragmatic knowledge, the disruption of standard patterns of thought, and also dealienation – you see what’s behind the interfaces that surround us, coming closer to the reality of our social world.”</p>
            <p class="thoughts">I think this brings to the discussion of the complicated definition of being prosocial or antisocial. Hacking as suggested by the article is about breaking standards to open accesses and therefore opportunities, which in traditional sense is considered anti-social for not following the preset norms. But when hacking is associated with the digital platform that is already open (still exclusive for those who do not have access to the internet and a device), it almost feels rational and unattackable to have things on the platform to be consistent in open access. Otherwise you should not host it on the free platform but another platform that aligns your values on the hackable and shareable open source. And because hacking could be for others and for more opportunities for the general public, it becomes prosocial. It is not essentially about a hacker’s personal leanings of whichever side, but more so about his/her/their standing point of view—the spirit of the ‘way of being.'</p>
