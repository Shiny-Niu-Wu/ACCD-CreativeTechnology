## A Wonderful Workday
**is a cross-platform communication project that produces web visuals using work messages between peers.**

Another day of WFH...
but you can start the day in the way you like, by receiving messages on your preferred platform
at the end of the day, there would be a proof of your hardwork
in the form of beautiful web visuals that collages all work messages,
a wonderful way to call it a day and have a cooled down moment with your colleagues.
